You can find the Java documentation at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) and the Java tutorials at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/). These resources cover all the topics that are included in the test and provide examples and exercises to help you practice.
- Practice with online coding platforms and mock tests. Another way to prepare for the IKM Java Questions 108 test is to practice your coding skills with online platforms and mock tests. You can find many websites that offer interactive coding challenges and quizzes in Java, such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Edabit](https://www.edabit.com/). These websites can help you improve your problem-solving skills and test your knowledge of Java concepts. You can also find some mock tests that simulate the IKM Java Questions 108 test format and difficulty level, such as [TestDome](https://www.testdome.com/tests/java-online-test/45) and [IndiaBIX](https://www.indiabix.com/online-test/java-programming-test/). These mock tests can help you familiarize yourself with the test structure and time limit.
- Study the feedback and explanations. After completing each practice question or mock test, make sure to study the feedback and explanations provided. These can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, learn from your mistakes and improve your understanding of Java concepts. You can also compare your solutions with other users' solutions and see how they approached the problem differently.

By following these tips, you can prepare for the IKM Java Questions 108 test effectively and confidently. Good luck!
  
## What to Expect from the IKM Java Questions 108 Test
 
The IKM Java Questions 108 test is a multiple-choice test that consists of 108 questions and has a duration of 90 minutes. The test is adaptive, which means that the difficulty level of each question is determined by your previous answers. The test also has a negative marking system, which means that you will lose points for incorrect answers. Therefore, you should answer each question carefully and avoid guessing.
 
The test covers the following topics:

1. Syntax: This topic tests your knowledge of the basic rules and structure of the Java language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, expressions, statements and comments.
2. Data Types: This topic tests your knowledge of the different types of data that can be stored and manipulated in Java, such as primitive types, reference types, enums, arrays and strings.
3. Operators: This topic tests your knowledge of the different operators that can be used in Java to perform various operations on data, such as arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, assignment and ternary operators.
4. Control Structures: This topic tests your knowledge of the different control structures that can be used in Java to control the flow of execution, such as if-else, switch-case, for, while, do-while and break-continue statements.
5. Arrays: This topic tests your knowledge of the arrays data structure in Java, which is used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. You will be tested on how to declare, initialize, access and manipulate arrays in Java.
6. Collections: This topic tests your knowledge of the collections framework in Java, which is used to store and manipulate groups of objects. You will be tested on how to use various collection interfaces and classes in Java, such as List, Set, Map, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap and TreeMap.
7. Generics: This topic tests your knowledge of the generics feature in Java, which is used to create generic classes and methods that can work with different types of objects. You will be tested on how to use generics to enhance type safety and avoid casting.
8. Exceptions: This topic tests your knowledge of the exception handling mechanism in Java, which is used to deal with errors and abnormal situations that may occur during program execution. You will be tested on how to use try-catch-finally blocks and throw and throws keywords to handle checked and unchecked exceptions in Java.
9. Concurrency: This topic tests your knowledge of the concurrency feature in Java, which is used to create and manage multiple threads of execution that can run simultaneously. You will be tested on how to use thread classes and interfaces in Java, such as Thread, Runnable, Callable, Future and ExecutorService.
10. Lambda Expressions: This topic tests your knowledge of the lambda expressions feature in Java 8, which is used to create anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments or assigned to variables. You will be tested on how to use lambda expressions to implement functional interfaces in Java.
11. Streams: This topic tests your knowledge of the streams feature in Java 8, which is used to process collections of data in a declarative way. You will be tested on how to use streams to perform various operations on data sources, such as filtering, mapping, reducing and collecting.
12. Functional Interfaces: This topic tests your knowledge of the functional interfaces feature in Java 8, which is used to define abstract methods that can be implemented by lambda expressions or method references. You will be tested on how to use various functional interfaces in Java 8,
